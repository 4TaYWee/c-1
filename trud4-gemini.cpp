/*
C++ itself has limited functionalities for directly managing processes. However, you can achieve process management using system calls provided by the operating system. Here's a basic example demonstrating how to start a new process:

C++
*/
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib> // for system()

int main() {
	// Replace "program_name" with the actual program you want to start
	std::string program_name = "program_name";
	
	// Construct the system command with arguments (if any)
	std::string command = program_name + " arguments";
	
	// Call system() to execute the command
	int result = system(command.c_str());
	
	if (result == -1) {
		std::cerr << "Error: Failed to start process." << std::endl;
	} else {
		std::cout << "Process started successfully." << std::endl;
	}
	
	return 0;
}

/*
Important notes:
This example demonstrates starting a new process. Stopping and resuming processes require platform-specific libraries or system calls. For Linux/Unix-like systems, you can explore libraries like popen or functions like fork, exec, and wait for more advanced process management.
Using system can be insecure as it executes arbitrary shell commands. Consider user input validation and proper command construction to avoid security vulnerabilities.
For portability and advanced process management, consider using platform-specific libraries or APIs.
