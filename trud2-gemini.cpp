/*
Explanation:
Include headers:
<cstdlib>: Provides the std::system function for executing system commands.
<iostream>: Provides std::cout and std::cerr for output.
Command String:
const char* command = "ls -l";: This line defines a constant character pointer named command and initializes it with the system command you want to execute. Replace "ls -l" with your desired command.
Execute Command:
int result = std::system(command);: This line calls the std::system function, passing the command string as an argument. The function attempts to execute the command and returns an integer value representing the exit status of the executed program.
Check Return Value:
if (result == 0) { ... } else { ... }: This conditional statement checks the return value of std::system.
If result is 0, the command executed successfully. A message indicating success is printed to std::cout.
If result is non-zero, there was an error executing the command. The error message includes the command string and the return value.
Return:
return 0;: The program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
Compiling and Running:
Save the code as a .cpp file (e.g., system_command.cpp).
Compile the code using a C++ compiler. The specific command will vary depending on your compiler. For example, with g++:
Bash
g++ system_command.cpp -o system_command


Run the compiled program from the command line, passing any necessary arguments to the command:
Bash
./system_command  # Replace with the actual program name


This program demonstrates a basic approach to executing system commands in C++. Remember to replace "ls -l" with the specific command you want to use.
Important Notes:
std::system is a powerful function but use it with caution. It can be less secure and portable than using dedicated libraries for specific tasks.
Consider using safer alternatives like popen or platform-specific APIs for more complex interactions with external programs.
