/*
Unfortunately, there's no entirely portable way to achieve this using standard C++. Here's a breakdown of two common approaches with limitations:
	1. Preprocessor Macros:
	This approach utilizes pre-defined macros set by the compiler depending on the operating system.
	
	C++
*/
	#include <iostream>
	
	#ifdef _WIN32
	#define OS_NAME "Windows"
	#elif defined(__APPLE__)
	#define OS_NAME "Mac OS X"
	#elif defined(__linux__)
	#define OS_NAME "Linux"
	#else
	#define OS_NAME "Unknown"
	#endif
	
	int main() {
		std::cout << "Operating System: " << OS_NAME << std::endl;
		
		// Further checks for version and architecture might require OS-specific libraries
		// or system calls (not portable).
		
		return 0;
	}
	
	
	Limitations:
	This approach only identifies the OS family (Windows, Mac, Linux).
	It relies on compiler-specific macros and might not work across all compilers.
	2. System Calls (Limited Portability):
	This approach uses system calls specific to the operating system to retrieve information. Here's an example for Linux using uname:
	
	C++
	
	#include <iostream>
	#include <cstring>
	#include <unistd.h>
	
	int main() {
		utsname buffer;
		if (uname(&buffer) == 0) {
			std::cout << "Operating System: " << buffer.sysname << std::endl;
			std::cout << "Version: " << buffer.release << std::endl;
			std::cout << "Architecture: " << buffer.machine << std::endl;
		} else {
			std::cerr << "Error retrieving system information" << std::endl;
		}
		
		return 0;
	}
	
/*
	Limitations:
	This code relies on uname which is specific to Unix-like systems (including Linux).
	System calls for retrieving detailed information vary across operating systems.
	Note:
	For retrieving detailed information like version and architecture, a combination of preprocessor checks and system calls specific to the identified OS might be necessary. This reduces portability significantly.
	Recommendation:
	Consider using a higher-level library or a scripting language like Python with platform-specific modules for better portability when retrieving detailed OS information.
