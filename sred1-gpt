	In c++ Write a program that changes access permissions to a particular file, for example by granting or revoking read, write, and execute rights.
	ChatGPT
	Certainly! Below is a simple C++ program that changes access permissions to a file using the `chmod()` function from the `<sys/stat.h>` header file.
	
	```cpp
*/	
#include <iostream>
	#include <sys/stat.h>
	
	int main() {
		const char *filename = "example.txt"; // Change this to your file's name
		const mode_t permissions = S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IXUSR; // Example permissions: Read, Write, Execute for the file owner
		
		int result = chmod(filename, permissions);
		
		if (result == 0) {
			std::cout << "Permissions changed successfully.\n";
		} else {
			std::cerr << "Error changing permissions.\n";
		}
		
		return 0;
	}
	```
	
/*
	Make sure to replace `"example.txt"` with the path of the file you want to change permissions for. Additionally, `S_IRUSR`, `S_IWUSR`, and `S_IXUSR` are symbolic constants representing read, write, and execute permissions for the file owner. You can combine them using bitwise OR (`|`) to set desired permissions. 
	
	Compile this program using a C++ compiler and run it with appropriate permissions to modify the file's access permissions.
